A #polygon is a two-dimensional shape that is made up of straight lines and has a closed boundary. Polygons are classified based on the number of sides they have.

## Types of Polygons

1.  #Triangles: A triangle is a polygon with three sides. There are several types of triangles, including equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles.
    
2.  #Quadrilaterals: A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. There are several types of quadrilaterals, including squares, rectangles, rhombi, and parallelograms.
    
3.  #Pentagons: A pentagon is a polygon with five sides.
    
4.  #Hexagons: A hexagon is a polygon with six sides.
    
5.  #Heptagons: A heptagon is a polygon with seven sides.
    
6.  #Octagons: An octagon is a polygon with eight sides.
    

## Properties of Polygons

1.  Sides: The number of sides a polygon has is referred to as its order.
    
2.  #Vertices: The points where two sides of a polygon meet are referred to as vertices.
    
3.  #Angles: The angles between two adjacent sides of a polygon are referred to as interior angles.
    
4.  #Perimeter: The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides.
    
5.  #Area: The area of a polygon can be calculated using various formulas depending on the type of polygon.
    

## Operations

In geometry, polyggons can be used to perform various operations and constructions.

### Finding the Perimeter of a Polygon

To find the perimeter of a polygon, we simply add up the lengths of all its sides.

### Finding the Area of a Polygon

To find the area of a polygon, we use the formula specific to the type of polygon. For example, the area of a triangle can be found using the formula: area = (base * height)/2.

### Regular Polygons

A regular polygon is a polygon in which all sides are equal in length and all interior angles are equal in measure. The area of a regular polygon can be calculated using the formula: area = (n * s^2)/(4 * tan(Ï€/n)), where n is the number of sides and s is the length of a side.

## Conclusion

Polygons are a fundamental concept in geometry and play a crucial role in understanding geometric shapes and figures. By studying their properties and performing various operations, we can gain a deeper understanding of their relationships and applications in various fields.
