# Piecewise Functions in Algebra

A piecewise function is a function defined by multiple formulas, each applied to a different part of the domain. In mathematical notation, a piecewise function can be written as:

scssCopy code

`f(x) = { g(x), if x is in the domain of g         
			``h`(x), if x is in the domain of h
			``...      
			 }`

## Domain of a Piecewise Function

The domain of a piecewise function is the set of all real numbers that can be plugged into the function without resulting in an undefined value.

For example, consider the piecewise function `f(x) = { x^2, if x >= 0 -x^2, if x < 0 }`

The domain of this function is all real numbers, because both `x^2` and `-x^2` are defined for all real numbers.

## Evaluating a Piecewise Function

To evaluate a piecewise function, we first determine the part of the domain that the input value falls into, and then apply the corresponding formula.

For example, to evaluate the piecewise function `f(x) = { x^2, if x >= 0 -x^2, if x < 0 }` at `x = 3`, we first determine that `3 >= 0`, so we use the first formula to find that `f(3) = 3^2 = 9`.

## Graphing a Piecewise Function

To graph a piecewise function, we first find key points on the graph by evaluating the function at important values of `x`, such as `x = 0`, `x = 1`, and `x = -1`. We then use these key points to determine the overall shape of the graph and connect the points to form the graph.

For example, to graph the piecewise function `f(x) = { x^2, if x >= 0 -x^2, if x < 0 }`, we could evaluate the function at `x = 0`, `x = 1`, and `x = -1` to find the key points `(0, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(-1, 1)`. We could then connect these points to form a parabolic shape for the positive part of the function and a mirrored parabolic shape for the negative part of the function.
