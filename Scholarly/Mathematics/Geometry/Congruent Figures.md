In geometry, #congruence refers to the idea of exact similarity between two or more figures. Congruent figures have the same size and shape, and their corresponding parts are in one-to-one correspondence.

## Conditions for Congruence

1.  SSS #Side-Side-Side Congruence: If three sides of one triangle are equal in length to three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
    
2.  SAS #Side-Angle-Side Congruence: If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal in length and measure to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
    
3.  ASA #Angle-Side-Angle Congruence: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal in measure and length to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
    
4.  HL #Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence: If the hypotenuse and a leg of one right triangle are equal in length to the corresponding parts of another right triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
    
5.  CPCTC #Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent: If two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding parts are also congruent.
    

## Operations Involving Congruent Figures

1.  Congruent Parts: When two or more figures are congruent, we can find the length of a missing side or angle by using the corresponding parts of the congruent figures.
    
2.  Angle Bisectors: If two figures are congruent, then the angle #bisectors of their corresponding angles are also congruent.
    
3.  Perimeter and Area: If two figures are congruent, then their #perimeter and #area are equal.
    
4.  Similar Figures: If two figures are similar, their corresponding sides are in proportion, and their corresponding angles have the same measure.
    

In conclusion, congruence is a fundamental concept in geometry that helps us understand the relationship between figures and their corresponding parts. Understanding the conditions and operations involving congruent figures is crucial for solving problems and furthering our knowledge in geometry and related fields.
