# Quadratic Functions in Algebra

A #quadraticFunction is a polynomial function of degree 2, defined as:

`f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c`

where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real coefficients.

## Domain and Range of a Quadratic Function

The domain of a quadratic function is all real numbers, because a quadratic function can be defined for any real value of `x`. The range of a quadratic function depends on the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`, but is always a set of real numbers.

## Graphing a Quadratic Function

To graph a quadratic function, we first find the `vertex` of the graph, which is a special point that helps us determine the overall shape of the graph. The `vertex` of a quadratic function is given by the formula:

`vertex = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))`

Once we have the `vertex`, we can use it to determine the shape of the graph. If `a > 0`, the graph will have a `U` shape, with the `vertex` as the lowest point on the graph. If `a < 0`, the graph will have an inverted `U` shape, with the `vertex` as the highest point on the graph.

We can also find the `x`-intercepts of the graph, which are the points where the graph crosses the `x`-axis. The `x`-intercepts of a quadratic function are given by the formula:

`x-intercepts = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`

## Solving a Quadratic Equation

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real coefficients. To solve a quadratic equation, we can use the `quadratic formula`:

`x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`

This formula gives us the `x`-values that solve the equation, which are also the `x`-intercepts of the corresponding quadratic function.
