# Linear Functions in Algebra

A linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line. In mathematical notation, a linear function can be expressed as `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope and `b` is the y-intercept of the line. The slope of a line is the change in `y` over the change in `x`, and the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

## Slope-Intercept Form

The standard form of a linear function is called the slope-intercept form, where `y = mx + b` and `m` is the slope and `b` is the y-intercept.

For example, the function `y = 2x + 1` is a linear function with a slope of `2` and a y-intercept of `1`.

## Point-Slope Form

Another form of a linear function is the point-slope form, where `y - y1 = m(x - x1)` and `m` is the slope and `(x1, y1)` is a point on the line.

For example, the function `y - 3 = -2(x - 4)` is a linear function with a slope of `-2` and a point on the line at `(4, 3)`.

## Evaluating a Linear Function

To evaluate a linear function, substitute a value of `x` into the function and simplify.

For example, to evaluate the function `y = 2x + 1` at `x = 3`, we substitute `3` for `x`:

`y = 2(3) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`

This means that the value of `y` when `x = 3` is `7`.

## Graphing a Linear Function

To graph a linear function, we can use either the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form.

In the slope-intercept form, we can find two points on the line by using the y-intercept and a point with an `x`-coordinate of `1`.

In the point-slope form, we can find two points on the line by using the point given and a point with a different `x`-coordinate.

Once we have two points on the line, we can plot them and draw a straight line through them to graph the function.
