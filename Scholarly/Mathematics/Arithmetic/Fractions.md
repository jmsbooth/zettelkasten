# Fractions in Arithmetic

#Fractions are a way of representing numbers that are not whole numbers. In arithmetic, fractions are used to perform operations involving non-whole values.

Here is a detailed explanation of how to perform arithmetic operations with fractions:

## 1. #Adding and #Subtracting Fractions

To add or subtract fractions, it is necessary to have a common denominator (the bottom part of the fraction) for all of the fractions involved in the operation. To find a common denominator, find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the denominators. Then, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the denominator. Finally, perform the operation on the numerators (the top part of the fraction) and write the result as a fraction with the common denominator.

For example:

`1/2 + 1/3 = (3x1)/(6x3) + (2x1)/(6x2) = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6  
`2/3 - 1/4 = (4x2)/(12x4) - (3x1)/(12x3) = 8/12 - 3/12 = 5/12`

## 2. #Multiplying Fractions

To multiply fractions, simply multiply the numerators and then multiply the denominators. The result is a new fraction with the product of the numerators as the numerator and the product of the denominators as the denominator.

For example:

`1/2 x 1/3 = (1x1)/(2x3) = 1/6  
`2/3 x 3/4 = (2x3)/(3x4) = 6/12 = 1/2`

## 3. #Dividing Fractions

To divide fractions, invert the second fraction (flip the numerator and denominator) and then multiply the first fraction by the inverted second fraction.

For example:

`1/2 ÷ 1/3 = (1x3)/(2x1) = 3/2  
`2/3 ÷ 3/4 = (2x4)/(3x3) = 8/9`

## 4. #Simplifying Fractions

When working with fractions, it may be useful to simplify the fraction to its lowest form. To simplify a fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

For example:

`10/20 = (10÷2)/(20÷2) = 5/10 = 1/2  
`36/48 = (36÷12)/(48÷12) = 3/4`

Note: Simplifying fractions can make the arithmetic operations easier to perform and the results easier to interpret.
