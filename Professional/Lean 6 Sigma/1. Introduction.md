## History of Lean and Six Sigma

-   The origins of Lean can be traced back to the Toyota Production System (TPS) developed by Toyota in the 1940s.
-   TPS aimed to minimize waste and inefficiencies in the production process by implementing a system based on continuous improvement and respect for people.
-   Six Sigma was first introduced by Motorola in the 1980s as a data-driven quality improvement methodology to reduce defects and improve customer satisfaction.
-   The integration of Lean and Six Sigma, known as Lean Six Sigma, occurred in the 1990s and combines the principles of Lean and Six Sigma to create a comprehensive approach to process improvement.

## Basic Principles of Lean Six Sigma

-   Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that focuses on reducing waste and variability in a process to improve quality, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.
-   It is based on a data-driven approach, where decisions are made based on analysis of facts and data rather than intuition or assumptions.
-   It involves a structured problem-solving approach known as DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) to identify and eliminate root causes of problems and improve process performance.
-   It emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement and employee involvement in identifying and implementing improvements.

## Benefits of Implementing Lean Six Sigma in an Organization

-   Improved quality and consistency of products and services.
-   Reduced waste, lead times, and costs.
-   Increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
-   Improved employee morale and engagement.
-   Enhanced competitiveness and profitability.
-   Improved compliance with regulations and standards.

By understanding the history, principles, and benefits of Lean Six Sigma, organizations can effectively implement this methodology and achieve significant improvements in process performance and customer satisfaction.

## Lean Six Sigma - Sigma Levels

Sigma levels are calculated in Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO). Below is a table of Sigma One to Sigma Six

| Sigma Level | DPMO    | Cost Per Error | Total Cost per DPMO |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| One Sigma   | 690,000 | $35            | $24,150,000         |
| Two Sigma   | 308,000 | $35            | $10,780,000         |
| Three Sigma | 66,800  | $35            | $2,338,000          |
| Four Sigma  | 6,200   | $35            | $217.000            |
| Five Sigma  | 233     | $35            | $8,155              |
| Six Sigma   | 3.4     | $35            | $119                |
|             |         |                |                     |

### Sigma Level is Not a Final Indicator

Sigma is not to be comparred between proceses. Leadership should also consider costs, resources, and the estimated impact of improvements. 

Just because a process has a sub-standard sigma level, the impact to the customer is the most improtant factor to be considered. 

Also, understanding the cost of the improvement is important to ensure that a cost-benefit analysis is completed.

## Challenges of Six Sigma

Six Sigma is often seen as expensive of unnecessary process, especially for small or mid-sized organizations. However, evidence has shown that this is not always true and often these smaller organizations can benefit just was much from Lean Six Sigma as larger orgnaizations.

Some obstacles and challenges that oftern stand in the way of positive resultes from Six Sigma include lack of support, resources, or knowledge, poor execution of projects, inconsistent access to valid statistical data, and concerns about using the methodology in new industries.

### Lack of Support

Leaders and executive must be willing to back initiatives with resources. SME's must be open to sharing information about their processes with project teams, and employees at all levels must embrace the idea of change and improvement and participate in training. Common barriers include:

-   Leaders that are unfamiliar with or don't understand the Six Sigma process.
-   Leaders willing to pursue improvements initially but who lose interest in overseeing and championing projects before they are completed
-   Staff that is fearful of change, especially in an environmetn when cahnge has historically caused negative consequences for employees
-   Employees who are resistent to change because they believe improvements might make them obsolete, drastically change thier jobs, or make their jobs harder.
- Department heads or employees who constantly champion their own process and needs and are unwilling to enter into big-picture thinking'

### Lack of Resources or Knowledge

Can be a big challenge for Six Sigma. Lack of knowledge about how to use or implement Six Sigma is on of the first issues seen. The availability of resoruces and Six Sigma training makes it increasingly possible for organizations to use some of the tools without an expert or to send in-house staff to be certified.

### Poor Project Execution

Companies implementing Six Sigma for the first time, especially in a project environment, often turn away from the entire methodology if the first project or improvement falls flat. Proponents really have to hit it out fot he park to win over leaders and others who might be on the fence.

Teams can help avoid avoid poor projects performance by taking extreme care to execute every phase of the project correctly. By choosing low-risk, high-reward improvements, teams can also stack the deck in the favor with first-time projects. 

Might be hard to replicate the big bang, so long term committment is vital.

### Data Access Issues

Some data challenges include:

-   Discovering that an important process metric is not being captured.
-   The use of manual data processes in many processes
-   Automated data processes that capture enormous amounts and create scope challenges
- Data that is skewed due to assumptions, human interaction in the process, or incorrect capture
- Lengthy times between raw data capture and access
- Industry or company compliance rules that make it difficult to gain access to necessaryu data

### Concerns about Using Six Sigma in a Specific Industry

Although Six Sigma started in the manufacturing industry the concepts and processes can be adopted by every industry without restriction.
