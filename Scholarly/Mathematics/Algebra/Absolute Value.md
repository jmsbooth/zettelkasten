In mathematics, the #absoluteValue of a number represents the distance of that number from zero on a number line. The absolute value of a number `x` is denoted as `|x|`.

## Properties of Absolute Value

-   The absolute value of a positive number is equal to the number itself.
-   The absolute value of a negative number is equal to the opposite of that number.
-   The absolute value of zero is equal to zero.

## Solving Absolute Value Equations

Given an absolute value equation of the form `|x| = a`, where `a` is a positive number, there are two solutions for `x`: `x = a` and `x = -a`.

Example: Solve for `x` in the equation `|x| = 5`:

-   `x = 5`
-   `x = -5`

When solving absolute value equations, it's important to remember that the solution must satisfy the equation for both positive and negative values of `x`.

## Absolute Value Inequalities

Absolute value #inequalities can be written in two forms: `|x| < a` or `|x| > a`.

To solve absolute value inequalities, we must first isolate the absolute value expression on one side of the inequality sign. We then split the inequality into two separate cases, one for positive values of `x` and one for negative values of `x`.

Example: Solve the inequality `|x| < 3`:

-   For positive values of `x`, `x < 3`.
-   For negative values of `x`, `-x < 3`, which implies `x > -3`.

The solution to the inequality `|x| < 3` is `-3 < x < 3`.

Note: Inequality signs change when #multiplying or #dividing by a negative number. To keep the direction of the inequality sign consistent, it's important to always isolate the absolute value expression on one side of the inequality sign before splitting the inequality into two separate cases.
