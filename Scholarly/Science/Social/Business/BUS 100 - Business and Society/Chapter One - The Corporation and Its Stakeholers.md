## Business and Society

#stakeholder : all those that affect, or are affected by the actions of the firm.
#business : any organization that is engaged in mkaing a product or proividing a service for a profit.
#society : human beings and the social structyures they collectively create

An important part of management's role is to identify a firm's relevant stakeholders and understand the nature of their interests, power, and alliances with one another. Building positive and mutually beneficial relationships across organizational boundaries can help enhance a company's reputation and address critical social and ethical challenges. In a world of fast-paced globalization, shifting public expectations and government policies, growing ecological concerns, and new technologies, managers face the difficult challenge of achieving economic results while simultaneously creating value for all of their diverse stakeholders. 

### A Systems Perspective

#GeneralSystemsTheory, first introduced in the 1940s, argues that all organisms are open to, and interact with, their external environments.

As applied to management theory, the systems concept implies that business firms (social organisms) are embedded in a broader social structure (external environment) with which they constantly interact. Corporations have ongoing boundary exchanges with customers, governments, competitors, suppliers, communities, and many other individuals and groups

#InteractiveSocialSystem is the formation of business and society working together.

## The Stakeholder Theory of the Firm

In the #ShareholdersTheory(sometimes called #OwnershipTheory) the firm is seeen as the property of its owners.

In the #StakeholdersTheory, the firm serves a broad purpose: to create value for society. Expressed by Laurence Finl, CEO of BlackRock. Formed by three main arguments: 
- #Descriptive: the stakeholder view is simply a more realistic description of how companies really work.
- #Intrumental:  stakeholder management is more effective as a corporate strategy. 
- #Normative : the stakeholder management is simply the right thing to do.

There is presedent in law for both theories. In the US we see #ShareholdersTheory with the establishment of managers as fiduciaries of the owners. #Fiduciary means a person who exercises power on behalf of another, that is, who acts as the other's agent. We also see state laws, where companies are chartered, that support #StakeholdersTheory .

Internationally, we see #StakeholdersTheory gaion more traction, specifically in the EU. 

### Stakeholder Concept

Managers make good decisions when they pay attention to the effects of their decisions on stakeholders, as well as stakeholders' effects on the company. 

On the positive side, strong relationships between a corporation and its stakeholders are an asset that adds value. 

On the negative side, some companies disregard stakeholders' interests, either out of the belief that the stakeholder is wrong or out of the misguided notion that an unhappy customer, employee, or regulator does not matter. 

### Different Kinds of Stakeholders

#MarketStakeholders : those that engage in economic transations with the company as it carries out its purpose of providing society with goods and services.

#NonmarketStakeholders : people and groups who - although they do non engage in direct ecnomic exchange with the firm - are nonetheless affected by or can affect its actions.

#InternalStakeholders : such as employees and managers, who are employed by the firm.

#ExternalStakeholders :  are those who - although they may have important transactions with the firm - are not directly employed by it.

The classification of government as a non market stakeholder has been controversial in stakeholder theory. Most theorists say that government is a nonmarket stakeholder (as does this book) because it does not normally conduct any direct market exchanges (buying and selling) with business. However, money often flows from business to government in the form of taxes and fees, and sometimes from government to business in the form of subsidies or incentives. Moreover, some businesses-defense contractors for example-do sell directly to the government and receive payment for goods and services rendered. For this reason, a few theorists have called government a market stakeholder of business. And, in a few cases, the government may take a direct ownership stake in a company-as the U.S. government did after the financial crisis of 2008-09 when it invested in several banks and auto companies, becoming a shareholder of these firms. Government also has special influence over business because of its ability LO charter and tax corporations, as well as make laws that regulate their activities. The unique relationship between government and business is discussed throughout this book.

Other stakeholders also have some market and some nonmarket characteristics. For example, business support groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, are normally considered a non market stakeholder. However, companies may support the Chamber of Commerce with their membership dues-a market exchange. Communities are a nonmarket stakeholder, but receive taxes, philanthropic contributions, and other monetary benefits from businesses. These subtleties are further explored in later chapters.
