A #circle is a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point, called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is known as the radius of the circle.

## Terminology

-   Center: the fixed point in the middle of the circle
-   Radius: the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle
-   Diameter: the length of a line segment that passes through the center of the circle and touches two points on the circle; the diameter is equal to 2 times the radius
-   Circumference: the distance around the circle, often represented as C = 2πr, where r is the radius
-   Chord: a line segment that connects two points on the circle
-   Secant: a line that intersects the circle at two points
-   Tangent: a line that intersects the circle at exactly one point
-   Arc: a portion of the circumference of the circle
-   Central Angle: an angle with its vertex at the center of the circle and sides that are chords of the circle
-   Inscribed Angle: an angle with its vertex on the circle and sides that are chords of the circle

## Constructing Circles

To construct a circle with a given radius and center, you can use a compass. The steps are as follows:

1.  Place the point of the compass on the center of the circle and adjust the width to the length of the radius
2.  Draw a complete circle by rotating the compass 360 degrees around the center point

## Measuring Circles

To find the circumference of a circle, you can use the formula: C = 2πr, where r is the radius

To find the area of a circle, you can use the formula: A = πr^2, where r is the radius

## Arcs and Chords

An arc is a portion of the circumference of a circle and can be measured in degrees. A central angle that subtends an arc can be used to find the length of the arc. The formula for finding the length of an arc is: L = (Θ/360) * C, where Θ is the measure of the central angle in degrees and C is the circumference of the circle

A chord is a line segment that connects two points on a circle. The length of a chord can be found using the Pythagorean theorem or by using the formula: L = 2r * sin(Θ/2), where r is the radius of the circle and Θ is the measure of the central angle that subtends the chord.

## Inscribed Angles and Polygons

An inscribed angle is an angle with its vertex on the circle and sides that are chords of the circle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

A polygon is a closed figure with three or more sides. If all vertices of a polygon are on the circle, it is called a cyclic polygon. In a cyclic polygon, the inscribed angles that subtend the same arc are equal.

## Tangents to a Circle

A tangent to a circle is a line that intersects the circle at exactly one point. The length of a tangent can be found using the formula: L = r + r, where r is the radius of the circle.

The radius perpendicular to a tangent at the point of tangency is called the external segment. The external segment can be found using the formula: L = r - r, where r is the radius of the circle.

## Secants and Exsecants

A secant is a line that intersects a circle at two points. The length of a secant can be found using the formula: L = r + r, where r is the distance between the two points of intersection.

An exsecant is a line that intersects a circle at two points and continues outside the circle. The length of an exsecant can be found using the formula: L = r + r, where r is the distance between the two points of intersection and the point of intersection with the extended line.

## Concentric Circles

Concentric circles are circles that have the same center. The distance between two concentric circles is equal to the difference between their radii.

In conclusion, circles play a crucial role in geometry, and the concepts discussed above are essential for understanding and solving problems related to circles.

## Circular Segments

A circular segment is a portion of a circle that is enclosed between an arc and a chord that connects the endpoints of the arc. The height of a circular segment is the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord.

## Properties of Circles

1.  Circles are symmetrical.
2.  The distance from the center to any point on the circle is equal, and it is called the radius.
3.  The circumference of a circle is proportional to its diameter and can be found using the formula C = 2πr.
4.  The area of a circle can be found using the formula A = πr^2.
5.  All radii of a circle are congruent and equal in length.
6.  A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
7.  The length of a chord is equal to the length of its associated arc.
8.  Inscribed angles are equal to half the measure of the central angles that subtend the same arc.
9.  All cyclic polyggon inscribed angles that subtend the same arc are equal.
10.  Concentric circles have the same center and different radii.

## Solving Problems Involving Circles

To solve problems involving circles, it is essential to have a good understanding of the properties of circles and the formulas discussed above. By using these concepts, it is possible to find the length of an arc, the area of a circle, the length of a chord, the external segment of a tangent, and the length of a secant, among others.

It is also important to understand the relationship between circles and other geometric shapes, such as triangles and polygons, as many problems involving circles can be solved by using these relationships.

In conclusion, circles are an essential concept in geometry and play a vital role in many areas of mathematics, engineering, and physics. Understanding the properties and formulas related to circles is crucial for solving problems and furthering our knowledge in these fields.
