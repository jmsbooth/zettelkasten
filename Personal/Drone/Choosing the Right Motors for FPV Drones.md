# Choosing the Right Motors for FPV Drones

When it comes to building or upgrading an FPV (first-person view) drone, one of the most important considerations is the choice of motors. The motors are responsible for providing the power and thrust that allows the drone to fly, and selecting the right motors can make a big difference in the performance and stability of your drone.

## Brushless vs. Brushed Motors

The first decision to make when choosing motors for your FPV drone is whether to go with brushless or brushed motors.

#BrushlesMotors are the more popular choice for FPV drones. They are more efficient, produce less heat, and have a longer lifespan compared to brushed motors. They also require less maintenance, which makes them a more convenient choice for hobbyists.

#BrushedMotors, on the other hand, are less expensive and simpler to manufacture, which makes them more accessible to beginners. However, they tend to wear out faster, produce more heat, and are less efficient than brushless motors.

## KV Rating

The #KVRating of a motor refers to the number of revolutions per minute (RPM) that the motor can achieve per volt of power. A higher KV rating means that the motor can spin faster, which results in more thrust and speed.

When choosing motors for your FPV drone, you'll want to consider the weight of your drone and the type of flying you'll be doing. For example, if you're building a heavy drone that will be used for freestyle flying, you'll want to choose motors with a lower KV rating that can provide more torque. On the other hand, if you're building a lightweight drone for racing, you'll want to choose motors with a higher KV rating that can provide more speed.

## Size and Weight

The size and weight of the motors are also important factors to consider when choosing motors for your FPV drone. Larger and heavier motors can provide more power and thrust, but they can also add weight to your drone and make it more difficult to maneuver. Smaller and lighter motors, on the other hand, can make your drone more agile and easier to control, but they may not provide as much power and thrust.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right motors for your FPV drone can make a big difference in the performance and stability of your drone. Brushless motors are generally considered to be the better choice for FPV drones due to their efficiency, lifespan, and low maintenance requirements. However, you'll also want to consider factors such as the KV rating, size, and weight of the motors in order to find the right motors for your drone and your specific needs.
