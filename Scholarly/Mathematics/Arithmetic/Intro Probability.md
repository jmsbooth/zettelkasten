# Introduction to Probability

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events. Probability is used to determine the likelihood or chance of an event occurring.

Here is a detailed explanation of the basic concepts and operations in probability:

## 1. Sample Space

A #SampleSpace is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, the sample space of rolling a dice is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

## 2. Events

An #event is a subset of the sample space that represents the outcome of an experiment. For example, rolling a 4 on a dice is an event.

## 3. Probability

#Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood or chance of an event occurring. The probability of an event A is given by the formula:

`P(A) = number of favorable outcomes / number of possible outcomes`

For example, the probability of rolling a 4 on a dice is 1/6.

## 4. #ComplementaryEvents

The complement of an event A is the set of all outcomes in the sample space that are not in event A. The probability of the complement of an event A is given by the formula:

`P(A') = 1 - P(A)`

For example, the complement of rolling a 4 on a dice is rolling any number except 4, and the probability of this event is 5/6.

## 5. #UnionOfEvents

The union of two events A and B is the set of all outcomes that belong to either event A or event B. The probability of the union of two events A and B is given by the formula:

`P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)`

For example, the union of rolling a 4 or a 5 on a dice is rolling either a 4 or a 5, and the probability of this event is 2/6.

## 6. #IntersectionOfEvents

The intersection of two events A and B is the set of all outcomes that belong to both events A and B. The probability of the intersection of two events A and B is given by the formula:

`P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A)`

where P(B | A) is the probability of event B given that event A has occurred.

For example, the intersection of rolling a 4 and getting a heads on a coin flip is rolling a 4 and getting heads, and the probability of this event is 1/6 * 1/2 = 1/12.

Note: These concepts and operations form the foundation of probability and are used to study more complex topics, such as conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and random variables.
