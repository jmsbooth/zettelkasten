# Beginning with JavaScript

JavaScript is a unique programming language with some key differences from other programming languages. Here are some of the ways that JavaScript stands out:

### Client-Side Execution

One of the biggest differences between JavaScript and other programming languages is that JavaScript is executed on the client-side, within the user's web browser. This means that JavaScript code is downloaded along with the HTML and CSS files, and executed on the user's computer rather than on the server. This allows for dynamic interactions with the user interface, without the need for the browser to communicate with the server for every user interaction.

### Interpreted Language

JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that code is executed line by line, as it is encountered. This is in contrast to compiled languages, where code is translated into machine code before being executed. This makes it easier and faster to develop code in JavaScript, as there is no need for a compilation step.

### Weakly Typed

JavaScript is a weakly typed language, which means that variables can be used to store any type of data, and the type of the variable can change at runtime. This is in contrast to strongly typed languages, where variables have a fixed type and cannot be changed. While this can make development faster, it can also lead to errors if variables are not used consistently throughout the code.

### Dynamic

JavaScript is a dynamic language, which means that it allows for changes to be made to the structure of an object or function at runtime. This is in contrast to static languages, where the structure of an object or function must be defined before it can be used. This dynamic nature of JavaScript allows for more flexibility and easier development.

### Prototypal Inheritance

JavaScript uses a unique form of inheritance called prototypal inheritance. This means that objects inherit properties and methods directly from their prototypes, rather than from a class hierarchy. This can take some time to get used to, but once you understand it, it can make code much more flexible and easier to maintain.

JavaScript is a popular programming language that can be used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. Here are some notes to help you get started with JavaScript:

## Adding JavaScript to a Web Page

To add JavaScript to a web page, you can include a script tag in the HTML file that references a JavaScript file, or you can include the JavaScript code directly in the HTML file.

### Including a JavaScript File

To include a JavaScript file in an HTML file, you can use the following code:

htmlCopy code

`<script src="path/to/your/javascript/file.js"></script>`

Make sure to replace `path/to/your/javascript/file.js` with the actual path to your JavaScript file.

### Including JavaScript Code in an HTML File

To include JavaScript code directly in an HTML file, you can use the following code:

htmlCopy code

`<script>   // Your JavaScript code goes here </script>`

## Working with Variables

Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. Here is how you can create and work with variables in JavaScript:

### Creating a Variable

To create a variable in JavaScript, you can use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword followed by the variable name and an optional initial value. **`let` is the most common and recommended way to set variables.**

javascriptCopy code

`var myVariable = "Hello World"; let myOtherVariable = 42; const MY_CONSTANT = 3.14;`

### Updating a Variable

You can update the value of a variable using the assignment operator (`=`).

javascriptCopy code

`myVariable = "Goodbye World"; myOtherVariable = 43;`

### Concatenating Strings

You can concatenate two or more strings in JavaScript using the `+` operator.

javascriptCopy code

`var greeting = "Hello"; var name = "John"; var message = greeting + " " + name;`



## Working with Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be called to perform a specific task. Here is how you can create and work with functions in JavaScript:

### Creating a Function

To create a function in JavaScript, you can use the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the function body.

javascriptCopy code

`function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {   // Function body goes here }`

### Calling a Function

You can call a function by using its name followed by parentheses and any necessary arguments.

javascriptCopy code

`myFunction(argument1, argument2);`
