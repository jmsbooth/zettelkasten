## Order of Operations in Arithmetic

#OrderOfOperations, also known as #PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction), is a set of rules used to determine the sequence in which mathematical operations should be performed.

The purpose of the order of operations is to ensure that mathematical expressions are evaluated consistently and accurately. Without a set order of operations, the same expression could have different values depending on how it was evaluated.

## The Order of Operations

The order of operations consists of the following steps:

1.  Perform any calculations inside parentheses first.
2.  Raise any numbers to their exponents.
3.  Perform all multiplications and divisions, from left to right.
4.  Perform all additions and subtractions, from left to right.

## Examples

Consider the expression: `2 + 3 * 4`. To evaluate this expression using the order of operations, we perform the following steps:

1.  No parentheses are present, so we move on to the next step.
2.  No exponents are present, so we move on to the next step.
3.  Perform the multiplication first: `3 * 4 = 12`.
4.  Replace the multiplication with its result: `2 + 12 = 14`.

The final result of the expression is 14.

## Conclusion

The order of operations is a fundamental concept in arithmetic that is used to ensure that mathematical expressions are evaluated consistently and accurately. By following the order of operations and using it consistently, you can avoid errors in your calculations and ensure that your results are accurate.
