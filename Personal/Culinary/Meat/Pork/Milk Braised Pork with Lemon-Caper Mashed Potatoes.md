# Ingredients
- 1 (3-4 lb.) boneless pork shoulder/butt
- Olive oil
- 2 1/2 t salt
- 1/2 t pepper
- 4 T butter, cubed
- 1 yellow onion
- 6 gloves garlic, peeled and smashed
- 1 bunch of sage
- 4 c whole milk
- 1 lemon, peeld and juiced

## Sauce
- 3 T butter, softened
- 3 T flour
- 2 T sage, chopped
- 1-2 T Dijon
- Salt and pepper

# Instructions

- Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
- Season pork shoulder with enough olive oil to glisten, along with salt and pepper
- In a Dutch oven, sear the pork over high heat on all sides. Remove from pan once caramelized all over, and set aside.
- Add butter, onion and garlic, and saut√© until golden.
- Add seared pork shoulder back in, along with remaining ingredients. (The liquid should reach 3/4 of the way to the top of the pork, so you may need to add more or less depending on the size of your pot.)
- Bring to a gentle simmer, pop the lid on and cook in the oven for 4 to 5 hours until tender.
- Remove pork; allow to cool slightly before slicing, or pull the meat with forks.
- Strain sauce, return to heat and reduce by half. Whisk in softened butter and flour along with sage and Dijon mustard. Season with salt and pepper, and serve drizzled over pork on a bed of lemon caper mashed potatoes.
