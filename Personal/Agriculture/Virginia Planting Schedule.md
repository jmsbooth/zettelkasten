It's important to note that some vegetables may not be suitable for planting at certain times of the year in Virginia due to weather conditions, so it's always good to check with your local nursery or extension office for specific recommendations for your area.

It's also important to keep in mind that starting seedlings indoors before transplanting them in the garden can also help you to have a more extended harvest season.

It is always good practice to keep track of the frost dates for your specific location. Knowing the expected last frost date in the spring and the first frost date in the fall can help you to determine when to plant and harvest your vegetables.

Remember to also take into account the specific needs of each vegetable, such as the type of soil, water, and sunlight they require to thrive.
