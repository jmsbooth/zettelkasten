# Decimals in Arithmetic

#Decimals are a way of representing fractional values in a compact form. In arithmetic, decimals are used to perform operations involving fractional values.

Here is a detailed explanation of how to perform arithmetic operations with decimals:

## 1. #Addition and #Subtraction

To add or subtract decimals, line up the decimal points and then perform the operation as you would with whole numbers.

For example:

`3.14 + 2.7 = 5.84  
`7.1 - 4.6 = 2.5`

## 2. #Multiplication

To multiply decimals, simply multiply the numbers as you would with whole numbers, and then count the total number of decimal places in the numbers being multiplied. The result should have the same number of decimal places.

For example:

`3.14 x 2 = 6.28  
`0.6 x 0.7 = 0.42`

## 3. #Division

To divide decimals, place the divisor (the number being divided by) to the right of the decimal point, and then divide as you would with whole numbers. The result will also be a decimal.

For example:

`7 รท 2.5 = 2.8  
`0.42 รท 0.6 = 0.7`

## 4. #Rounding Decimals

When working with decimals, it may be necessary to round the result to a specific number of decimal places. To round a decimal, look at the digit to the right of the desired decimal place. If it's 5 or higher, round up. If it's less than 5, round down.

For example:

`3.14 rounded to one decimal place = 3.1  
`2.7 rounded to the nearest whole number = 3`

Note: It's important to be careful when rounding decimals, as rounding errors can accumulate and impact the accuracy of your results.
