# Introduction to Geometry

#Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. Geometry is used to study the shape and size of objects, as well as their position in space.

Here is a detailed explanation of the basic concepts and operations in geometry:

## 1. #Points

A point is an object with no size or dimension that is used to describe the location of an object in space. Points are often labeled with capital letters.

## 2. #Lines

A line is an infinite set of points that extends in both directions without end. A line can be described by two points on the line or by an equation in slope-intercept form.

For example:

```Line AB: A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2)```
```Line y = mx + b: slope (m), y-intercept (b)```

## 3. #Angles

An angle is formed by two rays that share a common endpoint called the #vertex. Angles are measured in #degrees or #radians and are denoted by the symbol ∠.

For example:

`∠A = 30°
``∠B = 45°`

## 4. #Triangles

A triangle is a shape formed by three points in space that are connected by three line segments. Triangles can be classified by their sides #equilateral, #isosceles, #scalene or by their angles #right, #acute, #obtuse.

For example:

`Triangle ABC: A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3) 
`Equilateral triangle: all sides are equal 
`Isosceles triangle: two sides are equal 
`Scalene triangle: no sides are equal 
`Right triangle: one angle is 90° 
`Acute triangle: all angles are less than 90° 
`Obtuse triangle: one angle is greater than 90°`

## 5. #Quadrilaterals

A quadrilateral is a shape formed by four points in space that are connected by four line segments. Quadrilaterals can be classified by their sides and angles, such as #squares, #rectangles, #parallelograms, #rhombi, and #trapezoids.

For example:

`Quadrilateral ABCD: A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(x3, y3), D(x4, y4) 
`Square: all sides are equal, all angles are 90° 
`Rectangle: opposite sides are equal, all angles are 90° 
`Parallelogram: opposite sides are parallel, opposite angles are equal 
`Rhombus: all sides are equal, opposite angles are equal 
`Trapezoid: only two sides are parallel, no restrictions on angles`

## 6. #Circles

A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a center point. Circles can be described by their center and radius, and can also be described by an equation in standard form.

For example:

``Circle O: center (x, y), radius r 
`Circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2: center (h, k), radius r``

Note: These concepts and operations form the foundation of geometry and are used to study more complex topics, such as trigon
