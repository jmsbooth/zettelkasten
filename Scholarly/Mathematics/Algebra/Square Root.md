# Square Root in Algebra

The #squareRoot of a number `x` is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives `x`. In mathematical notation, the square root of `x` is represented by `√x` or `sqrt(x)`.

## Properties of the Square Root

-   The square root of a positive real number is always positive.
-   The square root of a negative real number is always imaginary.
-   The square root of a positive real number `x` is equal to its reciprocal, i.e. `√x = 1/√x`.
-   The square root of a number is always nonnegative, even if the number itself is negative.

## Computing the Square Root

To compute the square root of a positive real number `x`, there are several methods that can be used, including:

-   #Approximation using a calculator or computer software.
-   Using the long division method.
-   Using the #Newton-Raphson method.

In general, it is recommended to use a calculator or computer software for accurate results, as the square root of a number can be difficult to compute by hand for large numbers.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of computing the square root of numbers:

-   To compute the square root of `16`, we simply evaluate `√16` or `sqrt(16)`. The result is `4`.
-   To compute the square root of `9`, we evaluate `√9` or `sqrt(9)`. The result is `3`.
-   To compute the square root of `25`, we evaluate `√25` or `sqrt(25)`. The result is `5`.
