# Basic Arithmetic Operations

Here is a brief guide on how to perform basic arithmetic operations:

## 1. #Addition

To add two numbers, simply find their sum by starting from the rightmost digit and working your way to the leftmost digit.

## 2. #Subtraction

To subtract one number from another, start by subtracting the rightmost digits and then work your way to the leftmost digit. If a digit in the minuend is less than the corresponding digit in the subtrahend, you can borrow 10 from the digit to the left.

## 3. #Multiplication

To multiply two numbers, start by multiplying each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number. Then, add the products and carry over if necessary. Repeat this process for each pair of digits.

## 4. #Division

To divide one number by another, start by dividing the first digit of the dividend by the divisor. Then, multiply the divisor by the result and subtract the product from the dividend. Repeat this process for each digit of the dividend until you have found the quotient.

## 5. #Modulo (or the #remainderOperation)

The modulo operator returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. The symbol for modulo is `%`.

Note: These are the basic steps for performing arithmetic operations, but there are many other methods and techniques that can be used to perform these operations more efficiently or accurately.
