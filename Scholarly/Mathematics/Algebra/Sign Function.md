# Sign Function in Algebra

The #signFunction, also known as the `signum` function, is a mathematical function that returns the sign of a number. The sign function is defined as follows:

`sign(x) =   1 if x > 0   0 if x = 0  -1 if x < 0`

## Properties of the Sign Function

-   The #sign function is defined for all real numbers `x`.
-   The sign function is continuous everywhere, except at `x = 0`.
-   The sign function is an odd function, meaning that `sign(-x) = -sign(x)` for all `x â‰  0`.
-   The sign function is a step function, meaning that it has a discontinuity at `x = 0`.

## Uses of the Sign Function

The sign function is used in a variety of applications, including:

-   In #mathematics, the sign function is used to determine the direction of a number (positive, negative, or zero).
-   In #engineering, the sign function is used in the design of control systems and automatic feedback loops.
-   In #economics, the sign function is used to analyze market trends and make investment decisions.

## Computing the Sign Function

To compute the sign function for a given number `x`, we simply evaluate the expression `sign(x)` using the definition above. For example, if `x = -3`, then `sign(x) = -1`. If `x = 0`, then `sign(x) = 0`. And if `x = 5`, then `sign(x) = 1`.
