# Greatest Integer Function in Algebra

The #greatestIntegerFunction, also known as the floor function, maps a real number to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to that number. In mathematical notation, it is written as `⌊x⌋`, where `x` is the input.

For example, `⌊3.14⌋ = 3`, `⌊-2.99⌋ = -3`, and `⌊0⌋ = 0`.

## Evaluating the Greatest Integer Function

To evaluate the greatest integer function, we simply find the greatest integer that is less than or equal to the input value and replace the input value with that integer.

For example, to evaluate `⌊3.14⌋`, we find that `3` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `3.14`, so `⌊3.14⌋ = 3`.

## Properties of the Greatest Integer Function

1.  The domain of the greatest integer function is the set of all real numbers.
2.  The range of the greatest integer function is the set of all integers.
3.  The function is increasing, meaning that as the input increases, the output also increases.
4.  The function is discontinuous at all non-integer values. This means that there is a "jump" or "break" in the graph of the function at all points between two consecutive integers.

## Using the Greatest Integer Function

The greatest integer function is often used in mathematical modeling to round numbers to the nearest integer. It can also be used in other areas, such as computer science and cryptography, where it is necessary to work with integer values.
