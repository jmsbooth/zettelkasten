# Exponential Functions in Algebra

#ExponentialFunctions are mathematical functions that describe the growth or decay of a quantity over time. They are defined by the equation `f(x) = ab^x`, where `a` is the initial value, `b` is the growth factor, and `x` is the independent variable (usually time).

## Properties of Exponential Functions

-   `a` is the y-intercept, or the value of the function when `x = 0`.
-   `b` determines the rate of growth or decay. If `b > 1`, the function grows. If `0 < b < 1`, the function decays.
-   If `b > 1`, the function increases rapidly as `x` increases.
-   If `0 < b < 1`, the function decreases rapidly as `x` increases.

## Graphing Exponential Functions

Exponential functions can be graphed by finding key points on the graph and connecting them with a smooth curve. The key points are `(0, a)` and `(x, ab^x)` for various values of `x`.

## Solving Exponential Equations

Given an exponential equation of the form `a * b^x = c`, we can solve for `x` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides and using the logarithmic property `ln(ab^x) = xln(b) + ln(a)`.

Example: Solve for `x` in the equation `4 * 2^x = 16`:

`ln(4 * 2^x) = ln(16) xln(2) + ln(4) = ln(16) xln(2) = ln(16) - ln(4) x = (ln(16) - ln(4)) / ln(2)`

Note: This method can also be used to solve exponential equations with different bases. The only difference is that the logarithmic base must match the base of the exponential function in order to cancel out the logarithmic function and obtain the value of `x`.
