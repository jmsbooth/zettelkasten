"Objective and Key Results"

Started at Intel but is now widely used across multiple different sectors and organization.

The essence of this framework is to set challenging or ambitious goals with measurable results.

- Objective = Goal. What you are striving to achieve. The "what".
	- "I will <blank> as measured by <blank>"
	- To set an objective, start with these questions:
		- Does the objective help achieve company goals?
		- Does the objective inspire?
		- Does the objective move the company forward?
		- Is the objective timebound?
		- Is the objective set for the end of the quarter or the end of the year
	- Objectives should NOT:
		- Be easy
		- Projects with sub-tasks. They are aspirational goals
		- Not one-off activities. These are tasks or plans.
	- EX//
		- Achieve record 3rd quarter revenue growth

- Key Results = Measurable sub-task needed to meet goal. The "how".
	- KRs should be:
		- Specific
		- Quantifiable
		- Achievable
		- Lead to objective grading
		- Be difficulty, but not impossible
	- KRs are not:
		- Binary. Should be numeric and regularly updated
		- Not tasks to be achieved. Metrics to grade execution of tasks.
	- EX//
		- Generate $100k in new revenue
		- Reduce customer churn in the first quarter from 15% to 10%
		- Onboard 300 new clients

***IMPORTANT:***
- OKRs should not be used as a negative accountability tool. Only positive and informative.
- NOT the same as KPI's
