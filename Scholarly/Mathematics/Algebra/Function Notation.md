# Function Notation in Algebra

#FunctionNotation is a shorthand way of writing mathematical functions. In function notation, a function is represented by a single letter or symbol (the function name), and the input is written inside parentheses.

For example, the function that takes a number `x` as input and returns its square can be written as `f(x) = x^2`. Here, `f` is the function name, and `x` is the input. The expression `x^2` is the function's rule, which specifies what the function outputs for a given input.

## Evaluating Functions

To evaluate a function, we substitute the given input value into the function's rule and simplify. For example, to evaluate the function `f(x) = x^2` at `x = 3`, we substitute `3` for `x` and simplify:

scssCopy code

`f(3) = 3^2 = 9`

This means that the function `f(x) = x^2` outputs `9` when its input is `3`.

## Function Composition

Function composition is the process of applying one function to the output of another function. For example, given two functions `f(x) = x^2` and `g(x) = x + 1`, the composition of `f` and `g`, denoted `f(g(x))`, is a new function that outputs the result of applying `f` to the result of `g`.

Example:

scssCopy code

`f(g(x)) = f(x + 1) = (x + 1)^2`

## Inverse Functions

An #inverseFunction is a function that reverses the effect of another function. If `f(x)` is a function, its inverse, denoted `f^-1(x)`, is a function that takes the output of `f` as its input and returns the original input.

For example, the inverse of the function `f(x) = x^2` is the function `f^-1(x) = âˆšx`. This is because `f^-1(f(x)) = x` and `f(f^-1(x)) = x` for all `x` in the domain of the function.

Note: Not all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one, meaning that it maps every input to a unique output.
