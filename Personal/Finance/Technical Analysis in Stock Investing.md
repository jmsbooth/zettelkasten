# Technical Analysis in Stock Investing

#TechnicalAnalysis is a method of evaluating securities by analyzing statistics generated by market activity, such as past prices and volume. Technical analysts believe that the market discounts everything and that price movements are the result of supply and demand. Here are a few popular technical studies that investors use when stock investing:

## Moving Averages

A #MovingAverage is a trend-following indicator that calculates the average price of a security over a specified number of periods. It is one of the most commonly used technical indicators in stock trading and it smooths out the price action, making it easier to identify trends. There are several types of moving averages, including simple moving averages (SMA), exponential moving averages (EMA), and weighted moving averages (WMA).

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The Simple Moving Average #SMA is calculated by adding the closing price of a security for a number of periods and then dividing the total by the number of periods. The most commonly used SMAs are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. A stock trading above its 50-day moving average is considered to be in an uptrend, and a stock trading below its 50-day moving average is considered to be in a downtrend. Similarly, a stock trading above its 200-day moving average is considered to be in a long-term uptrend, and a stock trading below its 200-day moving average is considered to be in a long-term downtrend.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The Exponential Moving Average #EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to recent price changes. It is calculated by applying a percentage of the current closing price to the previous EMA. The most commonly used EMAs are the 12-day and 26-day moving averages. EMA's can be used to generate buy and sell signals by using crossovers, when the shorter-term EMA crosses above the longer-term EMA, it generates a buy signal, and when the shorter-term EMA crosses below the longer-term EMA, it generates a sell signal.

### Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

The Weighted Moving Average #WMA gives more weight to recent prices, similar to EMA, but the weighting is not exponential like the EMA. It is calculated by multiplying each closing price by a weighting factor and then dividing the total by the sum of the weighting factors.

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The Relative Strength Index #RSI indicator is a popular momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses in an attempt to determine overbought and oversold conditions of a stock. The RSI is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, with readings above 70 indicating overbought conditions and readings below 30 indicating oversold conditions.

### Calculation

The RSI is calculated using the following formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)) where RS = Average gain of up periods / Average loss of down periods

The RSI is typically calculated using a 14-day period, but it can be adjusted to suit the investor's preference.

### Signals

The RSI indicator generates buy and sell signals based on the stock's RSI reading. A buy signal is generated when the RSI falls below 30, indicating that the stock is oversold, and a sell signal is generated when the RSI rises above 70, indicating that the stock is overbought.

### Divergence

The RSI indicator can also be used to identify divergences between the stock's price and the indicator. A bullish divergence occurs when the stock's price makes a lower low but the RSI makes a higher low, indicating that the stock's downward momentum is weakening. A bearish divergence occurs when the stock's price makes a higher high but the RSI makes a lower high, indicating that the stock's upward momentum is weakening.

## Bollinger Bands

#BollingerBands indicator is a volatility indicator that was created by John Bollinger in the early 1980s. It consists of a moving average and two standard deviation lines that are plotted two standard deviations away from the moving average. The Bollinger Bands indicator can be used to identify overbought and oversold conditions, as well as potential reversal points in a stock's price.

### Calculation

The Bollinger Bands indicator uses a 20-day simple moving average (SMA) as the center line, with the upper band being calculated by adding two standard deviations to the SMA, and the lower band being calculated by subtracting two standard deviations from the SMA. The standard deviation is a statistical measure of volatility, which changes as the stock's price changes.

### Signals

The Bollinger Bands indicator generates buy and sell signals based on the relationship between the stock's price and the bands. A buy signal is generated when the stock's price touches or breaks below the lower band, indicating that the stock is oversold. A sell signal is generated when the stock's price touches or breaks above the upper band, indicating that the stock is overbought.

### Divergence

The Bollinger Bands indicator can also be used to identify divergences between the stock's price and the indicator. A bullish divergence occurs when the stock's price makes a lower low but the indicator makes a higher low, indicating that the stock's downward momentum is weakening. A bearish divergence occurs when the stock's price makes a higher high but the indicator makes a lower high, indicating that the stock's upward momentum is weakening.

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is a popular technical analysis tool used to determine the momentum and trend of a stock. It is a trend-following momentum indicator that uses the difference between two moving averages to determine the strength of a stock's momentum. Here's a breakdown of how the MACD indicator works:

### Calculation

The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. This difference is then plotted on a chart as a histogram, with a signal line that is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line.

### Signals

The MACD indicator generates buy and sell signals based on the relationship between the MACD line and the signal line. A buy signal is generated when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and a sell signal is generated when the MACD line crosses below the signal line.

### Divergence

The MACD indicator can also be used to identify divergences between the stock's price and the indicator. A bullish divergence occurs when the stock's price makes a lower low but the MACD makes a higher low, indicating that the stock's downward momentum is weakening. A bearish divergence occurs when the stock's price makes a higher high but the MACD makes a lower high, indicating that the stock's upward momentum is weakening.
