# Systems Engineering Configuration Management (SECM) 

The process of identifying, organizing, controlling, and verifying changes to a system throughout its lifecycle. The goal of #SECM is to ensure that the system remains consistent, reliable, and traceable, and that changes are made in a controlled and coordinated manner.

Implementing SECM within an organization involves several key steps:

1.  Establish a Configuration Management Plan #CMP: The CMP is a document that outlines the organization's SECM policies, procedures, and responsibilities. It should describe the processes for identifying, controlling, and verifying changes to the system, as well as the tools and techniques that will be used to manage the configuration.
    
2.  Identify the system's configuration items #CIs: CIs are the physical or functional parts of the system that require configuration management. Examples of CIs include hardware components, software code, and documentation. It is important to identify all CIs and establish a unique identifier for each one.
    
3.  Control changes to the CIs: Once the CIs have been identified, it is important to establish processes for controlling and approving changes to them. This includes identifying the person or group responsible for making changes, specifying the level of change control required, and establishing review and approval procedures.
    
4.  Implement configuration management tools: Tools such as version control software and configuration management databases can be used to track and control changes to the CIs. These tools can help ensure that changes are made in a controlled and coordinated manner and that the system remains consistent and reliable.
    
5.  Verify and Audit the configuration: This step ensures that the system's configuration is accurate and up-to-date. Configuration audits are conducted to verify that the CIs are properly identified, controlled, and tracked.
    
6.  Incorporate SECM into the systems engineering process: SECM should be integrated into the systems engineering process, with the configuration management plan being used to guide the development and management of the system.
    
7.  Train the team: The team should be trained on the configuration management plan and tools, as well as their roles and responsibilities in the SECM process.
    

By following these steps, an organization can implement a robust SECM process that helps ensure the system remains consistent, reliable, and traceable throughout its lifecycle.

# Using GIT

A system engineer can use Git, a popular version control system, to perform Systems Engineering Configuration Management (SECM) by:

1.  Initializing a repository: The system engineer can create a new repository in Git to store the configuration items (CIs) of the system. This repository will serve as the central location for managing and tracking changes to the CIs.
    
2.  Adding CIs to the repository: The system engineer can add the CIs of the system to the repository. This could include hardware components, software code, and documentation. Each CI should be given a unique identifier and tracked separately.
    
3.  Creating branches: The system engineer can create a #branch in the repository to separate different versions of the CIs. This allows for #ParallelDevelopment and testing of different features or configurations without affecting the main branch.
    
4.  Managing changes: The system engineer can use Git's features such as commits, pull requests, and merge conflicts to manage and control changes to the CIs. This includes reviewing, approving, and merging changes to the CIs.
    
5.  Auditing the configuration: The system engineer can use Git's logs and history feature to track changes to the CIs over time. This can be used to verify that the CIs are properly identified, controlled, and tracked.
    
6.  Incorporating SECM into the systems engineering process: The system engineer can integrate the use of Git into the systems engineering process, with the configuration management plan being used to guide the development and management of the system.
    

By using Git, a system engineer can perform SECM efficiently, by easily tracking and managing changes to the CIs, and maintaining the integrity of the system over its lifecycle.

Note that Git is just one of many version control systems out there, it is important to evaluate the suitability of the tool for your specific use case and organization.
