# Cube Root in Algebra

In mathematics, a #cubeRoot of a number `x` is a number `y` such that `y^3 = x`. The symbol for the cube root of `x` is denoted as `∛x` or `3√x`.

## Finding the Cube Root of a Number

To find the cube root of a number `x`, we must find a number `y` such that `y^3 = x`. This can be done by using a calculator or by estimation.

For example, to find the cube root of `8`, we can first estimate the answer by finding a number that, when cubed, is close to `8`. In this case, `2` is a good estimate because `2^3 = 8`.

To find a more accurate answer, we can use a calculator to find the cube root of `8`. Most calculators have a cube root function, usually denoted as `3√`. By entering `3√8` on a calculator, we get `2`.

## Simplifying Cube Roots

We can simplify cube roots by factoring the radicand (the number inside the cube root symbol) into smaller factors. For example:

`∛64 = ∛(4^3) = 4`

We can also simplify cube roots by using the properties of exponents. For example:

`∛(x^3) = x`

## Solving Cube Root Equations

Given a cube root equation of the form `y = ∛x`, we can solve for `y` by raising both sides of the equation to the power of `3`.

Example: Solve for `y` in the equation `y = ∛8`:

`y^3 = 8 y = 2`

Note: Cube root equations may have multiple solutions, just like square root equations. For example, `-2` is also a solution to the equation `y = ∛8` because `(-2)^3 = -8 = 8`.
