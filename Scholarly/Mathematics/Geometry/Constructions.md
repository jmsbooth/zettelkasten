In geometry, #constructions refer to the creation of geometric figures using only a limited set of tools, such as a compass and straightedge. Constructions are a fundamental aspect of geometry that allow us to explore the properties of figures and solve geometric problems.

## Tools for Constructions

The most commonly used tools for constructions in geometry are a compass and straightedge. A compass is used to draw circles and measure distances, while a straightedge is used to draw straight lines and measure lengths.

## Common Constructions

1.  #Point Construction: Creating a point at a specified location on a plane.
    
2.  #Line Construction: Creating a line segment or a ray that passes through two specified points.
    
3.  #Angle Construction: Creating an angle with a specified measure or between two specified lines.
    
4.  #Circle Construction: Creating a circle with a specified center and radius.
    
5.  #Perpendicular Line Construction: Creating a line perpendicular to a given line at a specified point on the line.
    
6.  #Bisector Construction: Creating a line that bisects an angle or a segment.
    
7.  #IntersectingLines Construction: Creating two lines that intersect at a specified point.
    
8.  #Parallel Line Construction: Creating a line parallel to a given line that passes through a specified point.
    

## Solving Problems Using Constructions

Constructions can be used to solve many geometric problems, such as finding the midpoint of a line segment, constructing an equilateral triangle, and finding the perpendicular bisector of a segment.

To solve problems using constructions, it is essential to understand the properties of geometric figures and to be able to use the tools correctly. By carefully following the steps of a construction and making precise measurements, it is possible to accurately create the desired figure and solve the problem at hand.

In conclusion, constructions are an important aspect of geometry that allow us to explore the properties of figures and solve problems. Understanding the tools and common constructions is crucial for solving problems and furthering our knowledge in geometry and related fields.
