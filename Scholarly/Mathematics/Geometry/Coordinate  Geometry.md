Coordinate geometry is a branch of mathematics that uses coordinates to represent points on a plane and to analyze the properties and relationships of geometric figures. It is a powerful tool for solving geometric problems and studying the properties of figures in a systematic way.

## Coordinate Plane

A coordinate plane is a two-dimensional plane that is divided into four quadrants by two perpendicular lines, called the x-axis and y-axis. The x-axis is a horizontal line and the y-axis is a vertical line.

Each point on the plane is represented by an ordered pair of numbers (x, y), where x is the distance from the point to the y-axis, and y is the distance from the point to the x-axis. The origin, (0, 0), is the point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect.

## Distance Formula

The distance formula is a useful tool for finding the distance between two points in the coordinate plane. The formula is:

d = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points, and d is the distance between the points.

## Midpoint Formula

The midpoint formula is used to find the midpoint of a line segment in the coordinate plane. The formula is:

Midpoint: ( (x1 + x2) / 2 , (y1 + y2) / 2 )

where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two endpoints of the line segment.

## Slope of a Line

The slope of a line in the coordinate plane is a measure of its steepness and direction. The formula for the slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

where m is the slope of the line.

## Equation of a Line

The equation of a line in the coordinate plane can be represented in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept, the point where the line intersects the y-axis.

## Solving Problems Using Coordinate Geometry

Coordinate geometry can be used to solve many geometric problems, such as finding the distance between two points, finding the equation of a line, and determining the slope of a line.

In conclusion, coordinate geometry is a powerful tool for solving geometric problems and studying the properties of figures in a systematic way. Understanding the coordinate plane, distance formula, midpoint formula, slope of a line, and equation of a line is crucial for solving problems and furthering our knowledge in geometry and related fields.

# 3-Dimensional Coordinate Geometry

In addition to the 2-dimensional coordinate plane, we also have the 3-dimensional coordinate space, represented by the x, y, and z axes.

## Points in 3-Dimensional Space

A point in 3-dimensional space is represented by an ordered triple (x, y, z), where x, y, and z represent the distances of the point from the x, y, and z axes, respectively.

## Distance Formula in 3-Dimensional Space

The distance formula in 3-dimensional space is an extension of the 2-dimensional distance formula, and is used to find the distance between two points in 3-dimensional space. The formula is:

d = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)

where (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) are the coordinates of the two points, and d is the distance between the points.

## Planes in 3-Dimensional Space

A plane in 3-dimensional space is represented by a point on the plane and a normal vector, which is perpendicular to the plane. The equation of a plane can be represented in the form Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, where A, B, C, and D are constants.

## Solving Problems Using 3-Dimensional Coordinate Geometry

3-dimensional coordinate geometry can be used to solve problems in areas such as computer graphics, engineering, and physics. It is an essential tool for understanding and solving problems in three-dimensional space.

In conclusion, 3-dimensional coordinate geometry provides a way to represent and analyze figures in three-dimensional space. Understanding the representation of points, distance formula, and planes in 3-dimensional space is crucial for solving problems and furthering our knowledge in related fields.
