# Percentages in Arithmetic

Percentages are a way of representing a number as a fraction of 100. They are used in many real-life situations, such as calculating interest rates, discounts, and taxes.

## Basic Operations

There are three basic operations you can perform with percentages: finding a percentage of a number, finding the percentage increase/decrease, and finding the original amount given the percentage and the final amount.

### Finding a Percentage of a Number

To find a percentage of a number, you need to multiply the number by the percentage in decimal form. For example, to find 30% of 100, you would multiply 100 by 0.30:

`100 * 0.30 = 30`

### Finding the Percentage Increase/Decrease

To find the percentage increase or decrease of a number, you need to first find the difference between the old and the new amount and then divide the difference by the old amount. To find the percentage increase, divide the difference by the old amount and multiply by 100. To find the percentage decrease, divide the difference by the old amount and multiply by 100 and then multiply by -1.

For example, let's say you had $100 and the value increased to $120. To find the percentage increase, we would:

`percentage increase = (120 - 100) / 100 * 100 = 20%`

### Finding the Original Amount

To find the original amount given the percentage and the final amount, you can use the following formula:

`original amount = final amount / (1 + percentage in decimal form)`

For example, if you have a final amount of $120 and the percentage is 20%, you can find the original amount as follows:

`original amount = 120 / (1 + 0.20) = 100`

## Conclusion

Percentages are a useful tool in arithmetic, allowing you to perform calculations involving ratios and proportions. By understanding the basic operations and formulas, you can perform a variety of calculations with confidence.
