# Inverse Functions in Algebra

An inverse function is a function that "undoes" another function. If `f(x)` is a function, its inverse, denoted `f^-1(x)`, is a function that takes the output of `f` as its input and returns the original input.

For example, the inverse of the function `f(x) = x^2` is the function `f^-1(x) = √x`. This is because `f^-1(f(x)) = x` and `f(f^-1(x)) = x` for all `x` in the domain of the function.

Note: Not all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one, meaning that it maps every input to a unique output.

## Finding the Inverse Function

To find the inverse function of `f(x)`, we follow these steps:

1.  Replace `f(x)` with `y`.
2.  Interchange the variables `x` and `y`.
3.  Solve for `y` to find `f^-1(x)`.

Example:

scssCopy code

`f(x) = x^2 y = x^2 x = y^2 f^-1(x) = √x`

## Evaluating the Inverse Function

To evaluate the inverse function `f^-1(x)`, we substitute the given value of `x` into the expression for `f^-1(x)` and simplify.

For example, to evaluate `f^-1(4)` where `f^-1(x) = √x`, we substitute `4` for `x` and simplify:

scssCopy code

`f^-1(4) = √4 = 2`

This means that `f^-1(4) = 2`, so the inverse function maps `4` to `2`.
