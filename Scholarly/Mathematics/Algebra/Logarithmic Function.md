# Logarithmic Functions in Algebra

A #logarithmicFunction is the inverse of an exponential function. In mathematical notation, a logarithmic function can be expressed as `y = logb(x)`, where `b` is the base of the logarithm.

## Properties of Logarithms

There are several important properties of #logarithms that are useful when working with logarithmic functions. Some of these properties include:

-   The logarithm of `1` to any base is equal to `0`.
-   The logarithm of `b` to base `b` is equal to `1`.
-   The logarithm of `x` to base `b` is equal to the logarithm of `x` to base `c` divided by the logarithm of `b` to base `c`.

## Evaluating Logarithms

To evaluate a logarithmic function, we need to find the power to which the base must be raised in order to produce the argument.

For example, to evaluate the logarithmic function `log2(8)`, we need to find the power to which `2` must be raised in order to produce `8`. Since `2^3 = 8`, the answer is `3`, so `log2(8) = 3`.

## Common Logarithms

The most commonly used logarithmic function has a base of `10`, and is referred to as the common logarithm. In mathematical notation, this is written as `log(x)`.

## Natural Logarithms

Another important logarithmic function has a base of `e`, where `e` is an irrational number approximately equal to `2.71828`. This function is called the natural logarithm, and is written as `ln(x)`.

## Change of Base Formula

The change of base formula allows us to evaluate logarithmic functions with any base. It states that `logb(x) = logc(x) / logc(b)`, where `b` and `c` are the bases of the logarithmic functions.

For example, to evaluate `log2(8)` using the change of base formula and the natural logarithm, we can write:

`log2(8) = ln(8) / ln(2)`

## Graphing Logarithmic Functions

To graph a logarithmic function, we can use the properties of logarithms to find key points on the graph. For example, the logarithm of `1` to any base is equal to `0`, so the point `(1, 0)` is always on the graph of a logarithmic function. Additionally, the logarithm of the base to itself is equal to `1`, so the point `(b, 1)` is always on the graph of a logarithmic function with base `b`.
