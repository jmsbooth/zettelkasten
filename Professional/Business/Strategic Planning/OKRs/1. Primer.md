"Objective and Key Results"

Started at Intel but is now widely used across multiple different sectors and organization.

The essence of this framework is to set challenging or ambitious goals with measurable results.

- Objective = Goal. What you are striving to achieve. The "what".
	- "I will <blank> as measured by <blank>"
	- To set an objective, start with these questions:
		- Does the objective help achieve company goals?
		- Does the objective inspire?
		- Does the objective move the company forward?
		- Is the objective timebound?
		- Is the objective set for the end of the quarter or the end of the year
	- Objectives should NOT:
		- Be easy
		- 

- Key Results = Measurable sub-task needed to meet goal. The "how".

***IMPORTANT:***
- OKRs should not be used as a negative accountability tool. Only positive and informative.
- NOT the same as KPI's
